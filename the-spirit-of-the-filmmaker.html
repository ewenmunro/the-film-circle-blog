            What makes a great filmmaker? As a filmmaker myself, I used to
            ponder this question, a lot. And I also used to listen to other
            filmmakers give their answer to this question. Some of those answers
            have included: patience, hustle, working smart, hiring the right
            team, etc., etc. But unfortunately, at least from my understanding
            of things, I don’t feel that any of these answers in and of
            themselves are the answer to what makes a great filmmaker, simply
            because they’re too small. These prescribed answers, by the very
            nature of them being prescribed, don’t come with the full picture as
            to why a particular filmmaker has achieved success. And sadly, this
            leads wannabe filmmakers down bad paths with a narrow frame of mind.
            And considering that these types of answers come with a lack of
            understanding, it might be worthwhile to ask one’s self: Can anyone
            achieve success without understanding?
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage, you might begin to think that “understanding” is the
            reason for why a particular filmmaker has become successful, but
            this is, again, the same problem. By declaring that understanding is
            the answer to what makes a great filmmaker, you have turned
            understanding into a prescription and thus, are not going to broaden
            your understanding. What this all reflects is that the mentality of
            searching for a prescription, a hack, a “how-to”, won’t provide you
            with the understanding that is required to get you where you’d like
            to go. It’s this frame of mind that is holding wannabe filmmakers
            back.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what makes this dilemma worse, especially for those who are new
            to film and don’t know any better, is that the entire film industry
            is filled with prescribed answers. For example, you will be told
            that you have to use The Hero’s Journey in your screenplays, you
            have to have coverage on shoot, you have to have 3-point lighting,
            etc., etc. You’re told that if you do these things that you will
            become a great filmmaker. But the results speak for themselves. Not
            every film that has The Hero’s Journey is a great film. And
            conversely, there are some films that didn’t use The Hero’s Journey
            that are great films.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be fair, when it comes to these examples, such as The Hero’s
            Journey, these examples are resources, resources that can be very
            useful, in the same way that a hammer is a very useful resource. But
            you wouldn’t paint a wall with a hammer. So, this mentality that you
            must have, for example, The Hero’s Journey in all your films is
            stupid. This highlights that it’s much wiser to understand what The
            Hero’s Journey is, why filmmakers use it and develop the judgement
            as to whether or not to use The Hero’s Journey with the given film
            you are making.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what makes this mentality especially insidious is when this
            frame of mind persists despite negative results. When less and less
            people are going to the cinemas, when subscribers are leaving
            streaming platforms, when the amount of negative reviews increases,
            when films are earning less and less money, many within the film
            industry will tell you that you still have to follow their standard,
            even though it’s not working. And it appears that the only reason
            why they’re saying this is because they simply don’t know what else
            to do and don’t want to confront themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this all tells us anything it’s that arrogance is the death of
            film. We can’t always continue to do what was done before simply
            because that’s the way it has always been. Film must evolve. Film
            must continue to search for new ways to express itself. And this can
            only be done through filmmakers who are inspired to innovate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next question that is probably on your mind is: How does a
            filmmaker innovate? Ironically, this is going back to the same
            problem that we were presented with at the beginning of this blog
            post. Filmmakers cannot ask questions that’ll lead to prescribed
            answers. But since arrogance is the death of film, then maybe,
            adopting a frame of mind of not-knowing is the path forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the 1960s, a handful of filmmakers in France, were
            disillusioned by the films coming out of America and decided that
            they were going to make films that didn’t follow the standard at the
            time. They’d use the environment around them, they’d have longer
            takes, improvisation, breaking the 4th wall, completely messed
            around with editing, plot, story etc., etc. This became the French
            New Wave. And this new wave of films has had one of the biggest
            impacts, if not the biggest impact, on film. Ironically, the French
            New Wave died as soon as these filmmakers started to argue that
            their way of making films was the right way. But these filmmakers
            started out with the intention of doing things differently, whilst
            also not knowing whether or not what they were doing would work.
          </p>
          <p>
            And fittingly, this is how our minds work. Many of us seem to be
            under some illusion that how we think is that we extrapolate
            knowledge from the external work and treat it as such. But this is
            not the case. If it were then every fact that was ever conceived
            would remain a fact. The sun would still revolve around the earth.
            How we really think is that we have a theory as to what might
            happen, vet that theory against reality, which then leads us to a
            realization and this, in turn, develops into another theory. But at
            no point in this process are we taking knowledge from the external
            world. A lot of us just pretend that we know things, when really no
            one has a clue.
          </p>

            So, where does this leave you? I don’t know. I don’t know what’s
            best for you. And I don’t know how you’re going to become a
            successful filmmaker, assuming that that’s what you want to become.
            So, instead, let me pose to you a different question: Why aren’t you
            where you claim you’d like to be?
