                <article class="text">
                    <p>When I graduated high school, I had a plan to study in America. 
                        But because I am from Australia and with the different school calendar years, 
                        I had a lot of free time between graduation and going to America. 
                        I worked a bit, travelled, did a number of things, but I became fairly bored. 
                        However, in that boredom I came up with an idea for a feature film that I was
                        inspired to write. So, I would lock myself in my room and write and write and write. 
                        I didn’t really know what I was doing. I didn’t know how to format a screenplay. 
                        I just wrote. And two weeks later I developed my first feature script. 
                        This ignited a fire within me to make films. 
                        And since then, I have been doing just that, writing many scripts, 
                        making short films and even producing my own feature film 
                        (you can find out more about my first feature
                        <a href="https://ewenmunro.com/sunyata" target="_blank">here</a>). 
                        But this journey hasn’t come without its headaches.</p>
                    <p>Even though I have done quite a lot in film this has also come with 
                        a disillusionment of the film industry. Consistently, I would find myself 
                        in a scenario where I’m meeting with someone, usually a producer, to talk 
                        about working on a project, only for the conversation to go sour. 
                        To be fair, all of those projects that I shared with those producers I was 
                        attempting to get made because I thought they would make money, or would 
                        enable me to build a career. None of those projects were projects that I 
                        would say I was proud of, and looking back on it, I’m glad those projects 
                        never got made. The whole making films vs. business is a blog for another time. 
                        But all of these situations led me to having to do virtually everything myself, 
                        which I actually did with my first feature. I did everything except act in that 
                        film.</p>
                    <p>However, it wasn’t those meetings falling through that has led to my 
                        disillusionment of the film industry. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. 
                        What has bothered me is the general attitude of the people in the film 
                        industry, not only the people I have encountered, but also the stories 
                        I’ve heard of from other filmmakers. Take for instance the typical 
                        conversations that I would have in those meetings. Almost all of them 
                        would follow this same pattern:</p>
                    <p class="text-list">1) I’d ask them what they thought of my project.</p>
                    <p class="text-list">2) They’d go on this long spiel about why the project 
                        won’t work.</p>
                    <p class="text-list">3) That’s it.</p>
                    <p>They wouldn’t even ask for my own thoughts. And even worse was when they made a 
                        suggestion because their suggestions were terrible. This is not meant to be 
                        demeaning. I don’t like to be mean. But I write that their suggestions were 
                        terrible because their suggestions don’t work. They simply don’t work. 
                        And the evidence proves it. They would suggest to make the film a certain way, 
                        which happens to be the same way as every other film being made, without 
                        realizing that this trend of making every film like every other film is what is 
                        leading the film industry to lose variety and causing viewers to seek other 
                        forms of entertainment. And you’d think, especially from a business point of 
                        view, as a business, wouldn’t you want to own a product that everyone else 
                        wants but no one else knows how to get? And how are you going to do that when 
                        all the films that are being produced are like every other film being produced? 
                        It’s crazy. They simply believe that films must be made in a certain way 
                        without even thinking through what they believe. And my guess as to why the 
                        industry thinks the way that does is because everyone else in the industry 
                        thinks the way that it does. It’s social proofing at its finest. And this is 
                        all just the tip of the iceberg. This consistent scenario doesn’t even take 
                        into account all the lies, the broken promises, the overwhelming level of 
                        conceit, just the overall lack of integrity that I’ve encountered and heard 
                        from other filmmakers. All of this has led me to feel that if you want to make 
                        the films and have a film career, the best way to go about it is to <u>not</u> 
                        be in the film industry.</p>
                    <p>Having written all that, I do not feel despair. All of these failed meetings 
                        have led me to realize if I wanted to make my own films I’m going to have to 
                        learn to produce them myself. And now, I am doing just that. I am producing 
                        my own films, and I have an approach that works for me, my sensibilities and 
                        my interests, and I don’t need the approval of any of gatekeeper to make a film. 
                        I feel that I am in a good place in regards to making and sharing films that 
                        inspire me. But then that begs the question:</p>
                    <p class="significant-text">Why start this blog?</p>
                    <p>While I am appreciative of where I am at, a part of me would like to have at 
                        least some modicum of optimism in film. Not a chaotic optimism that says you 
                        can be anything you want to be. That lie comes in droves. But a form of 
                        optimism that what I would describe as a level-headed optimism, one that 
                        honestly acknowledges the difficulties of making the films you want to make 
                        whilst encouraging you to make that film in a practical way. It is this 
                        form of optimism that I would like to see injected into film. And I figure, 
                        why not be the one to do that?</p>
                    <p>Now, before I leave you, I am going to answer some questions 
                        you might have for the blog:</p>
                    <p><i>Q1) How frequently do you plan on writing a blog post?</i></p>
                    <p>A: Honestly, not all that frequently. I don’t like the idea of writing a set 
                        amount within a certain timeframe because then I’d feel that I’d have to 
                        write in order to fulfil that quota instead of simply writing something 
                        because I am inspired to write it. Plus, I feel that I can go more in 
                        depth on a subject by writing without a deadline, which I prefer. 
                        So, I don’t know how often I’d be writing. </p>
                    <p><i>Q2) Why a blog? Why not share your thoughts in video? Or via a podcast? 
                        Or any other medium?</i></p>
                    <p>A: I have thought about using other formats, however, I find that writing 
                        helps me to structure and, in turn, focus my thoughts in a way that other 
                        mediums don’t allow me to. With video and podcasting, for example, I feel 
                        that I can go all over the place and for what I’m doing, I feel that 
                        structure is valuable. Hence, why The Film Circle is a blog.</p>
                    <p><i>Q3) Who is this blog for?</i></p>
                    <p>A: It is for the 3 naturally talented individuals who have a uniqueness 
                        about them that is roaring to come out and who can’t help but make films 
                        but who are also fed up with the state of the film industry and are 
                        exploring alternative ways to making the films that inspire them that 
                        come with less resistance.</p>
                    <p><i>Q4) Do you plan on having other writers contribute to your blog?</i></p>
                    <p>A: At this point, no. If this blog does happen to take off – whether or not 
                        the blog does take off has little to do with me, to be honest – the reason 
                        why it took off was probably because readers were interested in what I 
                        had to write. It wouldn’t make sense to then add more writers to the blog 
                        for the sake of writing more when the value the reader got was from what 
                        I had written. So, I doubt it.</p>
                    <p><i>Q5) How can we be notified as to when you’ve posted the next blog?</i></p>
                    <p>A: The best way is to follow me on my own socials, which you can find at 
                        the bottom of my website: <a href="https://ewenmunro.com/" 
                        target="_blank">ewenmunro.com</a></p>
                    <p><i>Q6) How can we support the blog?</i></p>
                    <p>A: You can support the blog by sharing it and/or donating via my 
                        website: <a href="https://ewenmunro.com/donate"
