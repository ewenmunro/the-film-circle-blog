            <i>Transmedia storytelling</i> is where you tell one story across
            multiple platforms. You can see this form of storytelling happen
            with a number of different high-profile properties from the major
            studios at the moment, where they tell one massive story across
            film, TV, books, comic books, etc. And this form of storytelling is
            beginning to gain popularity amongst filmmakers for obvious reasons.
            By telling your story across different platforms, you can reach
            different audiences and even cross-promote your material across the
            various mediums you are telling your story.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the way that this idea has been pushed into the psyche of
            the entertainment world does, at least to me, come across as a bit
            romanticised. It can create this illusion that if you tell your
            stories across multiple platforms that you will without a shadow of
            a doubt build an audience, make a whole lot of money and, in turn,
            become successful. This is obviously not the case. The market might
            simply not be interested in your story no matter what medium you
            tell it in.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a side note, there are a number of people who push this idea that
            you can be anything you want to be, that you should follow your
            dreams and ignore anyone who says otherwise. But this is really
            quite misleading and can even send people down a very dark path.
            What is missed here is that while you might be interested and even
            incredibly talented at a particular skill that doesn’t necessarily
            mean that the market is willing to pay you for that skill (at least
            not yet). And to become successful, from a financial perspective,
            you require both talent in that particular skill and the market has
            to value your talent, at least to the point where the market is
            willing to pay you enough so that you can survive on your talent. To
            say that you can be anything you want to be is like looking at one
            side of a coin. It doesn’t tell the whole story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, back to transmedia storytelling, while there is this
            illusion that seems to be forming around transmedia storytelling, I
            feel that there is a more structured way in which we, as filmmakers,
            can utilise this approach in order to mitigate the risks that
            naturally come from filmmaking and remain in control of our stories,
            that seems so blatantly obvious, but is also not being done, at
            least from what I could find, by anyone else and, in turn, isn’t
            being shared. And so, let us use an example here to highlight this
            approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say you have an idea for a huge sci-fi film. The film has the
            protagonist travelling to various worlds, encountering various
            creatures, is action packed, etc., etc. This film is obviously going
            to cost a boat load of money. Let’s say the budget is $100 million.
            And just to make it even more difficult, let’s say you have never
            made a film before. Not a feature film. Not a short. Nothing. Now,
            firstly, most of us don’t have that kind of money to drop, and
            secondly, no studio would be willing to take that kind of a chance
            on an unknown property, especially when you have never made a film
            before. Not a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            What you could do is create a backstory for the protagonist in
            another medium, whether that medium be a written short story, or a
            podcast, or a video blog, it doesn’t really matter, but essentially,
            what you are doing is creating a story that relates to the grander
            idea you have for the film. Once that is done, what you could then
            do is sit down and theorise who might be interested in this story
            that you created in another medium (we’ll use a written short story
            from here on out to make the rest of the example concise), creating
            a list of demographics who might be interested in your written short
            story and then order the list based on who you theorise would be
            most interested in your written short story. You could then go down
            the list, from the demographic you theorise would be most interested
            in your written short story to the least interested, and vet your
            written story against these demographics to test whether or not your
            idea could find a viable audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, there is something to keep in mind here. There is a good reason
            why I chose written short story instead of a book. While books are
            great, and there are a lot of book enthusiasts, what you are testing
            is the response from these demographics and with a book, seeing as
            you will probably have to charge the person you are handing your
            book to in order to make up the costs of producing the book, there
            will be a barrier between you and what you are really after, which
            is market response. Therefore, the type of content you are looking
            to create here is content that ideally:
          </p>
          <p class="text-list">
            1) You can make for free (so you don’t have to incur any costs)
          </p>
          <p class="text-list">2) You can share for free</p>
          <p class="text-list">3) You can make money off of</p>
          <p>
            This is why a written short story would be a great way to test
            market response, since you can write it for free on your computer,
            share it with people for free, either in person, via email or social
            media and can make money off of by suppling a link at the end of the
            short story so that the reader can donate money to you if they so
            wish to.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you then share your written short story, what you will begin to
            realise is that in your list of demographics that one demographic
            will elicit a greater response, in that they are willing to send you
            more money, than the other demographics on your list. Once you have
            identified this demographic, you would then find more people of this
            demographic and share your written short story with them. The idea
            here is to focus on the demographic which elicits the strongest
            response so you can get the greatest return.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you are doing this, and are beginning to build an audience,
            what you could then do is use the money that you are earning to now
            write a book. The reason why you are writing a book now is because
            you can further expand on the written short story you have and
            because you have an existing audience who are already interested and
            excited to see where your story goes. The book is written and shared
            with your audience, which increases your earnings, expands your
            community through network effects, and the momentum you have
            continues to build.
          </p>
          <p>
            And with your further earnings, you could use that money to adapt
            your story into other mediums, even if this requires you to
            collaborate with other artists, which, in turn, provides more value
            to your existing audience, whilst at the same time, introduces you
            to potentially new audience members who could join your community.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might be at this point where you’re wondering when you are going
            to make your sci-fi epic, and this is coming. But what you should
            understand here is where the studios – who are really the only
            people who could fund your expensive film – are coming from. What
            studios want is to make sure they can make a return on their
            investment. And what you are doing by building this audience is
            highlighting to the studios that you have a property that can give
            them a return on their investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another idea that might have come to your mind is that while you are
            building your audience what you could also be doing is reaching out
            to these studios to pitch your film. But the studios don’t tend to
            allow anyone they don’t know, even with a large audience, to just
            pitch to them their film idea. You’d either have to have a
            connection that could get you in the door or they would have to
            reach out to you. And while networking in the film industry isn’t a
            bad idea to try to meet the person who could get you in the door, as
            you build your audience, it would make more sense to just continue
            to build your community, since that’s the very reason why the studio
            would be interested in you in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, as you continue to build your community, at some point, it will
            all click and the person who could give you the opportunity to make
            your sci-fi epic is now able to do so. And even though the journey
            to this point might have taken longer than it might have otherwise –
            although, you can never know how long it would have actually taken
            you to make the film doing coffee meetings with people you don’t
            really know on an empty idea that hasn’t been tested against the
            market – you have more leverage in the meeting and can get more out
            of the opportunity. You can negotiate terms that work and make sense
            for you because if they don’t agree to it there is nothing to stop a
            rival studio from approaching you to make your film. You have
            leverage. You don’t have to take a deal out of some fear you imposed
            on yourself. You get to decide here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you’re probably thinking that this is all well said and good,
            but what if none of the demographics on our list are interested in
            your written short story. And this is a fair point. And it’s
            difficult for me to suggest a response with a hypothetical example.
            But what you’re trying to establish is whether or not the audience
            is interested in your <u>idea</u>. If the audience is just not
            interested in reading a short story, then adapt the story into
            another medium, a medium they would be interested in. And if they’re
            not interested in your idea, then no loss. It didn’t cost you any
            money to write the short story. Sure, you put in time to make and
            share the short story you wrote, but no much more time than you
            would have in trying to pitch a film idea to a studio. And really,
            what you gained here is the realization that there isn’t an audience
            for your film idea and that your film idea was never financially
            feasible (at least not yet). And guess what, that’s okay. You could
            come up with another idea, go through this process again and build
            an audience the next time around. At least this way, you’re not
            wasting time wondering whether or not your film would work by simply
            doing your homework beforehand. And after you’ve gone through the
            process and have built up an audience on a different property,
            there’s no reason why you couldn’t reintroduce your original idea to
            your audience now. You are at a different starting position than you
            were before, which you can take advantage of.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all this in mind, this approach definitely isn’t for everyone.
            For one, we all come with different aptitudes, and if you simply
            don’t have the talent or the interest for it, then this approach
            isn’t worth doing. And personally, I am not following the example
            laid out in this blog post. I have adopted an approach that works
            for me, with my sensibilities and understanding of things. Not that
            my way of doing things should deter you from giving the approach
            highlighted in this blog post a go, but what we are putting forward
            here is that understanding yourself should come before any advice
            anyone ever gives you. If this is not for you, then this is not for
            you. It’s as simple as that.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, what we have reflected here is an approach that doesn’t
            require anyone’s approval. You don’t need anyone’s permission to
            make films anymore. You don’t need to suck up to some exec just to
            get a film made. You have everything you need, right here. Now, show
            us what you can do.
