            <section>
                <article class="text">
                    <p>One of the more apparent problems that gets raised in 
                        film is the lack of opportunities for any want to be 
                        filmmakers, actors, etc. You ask anyone who has a desire 
                        to break into the film industry what they would consider 
                        to be the biggest difficulty that they face, and they 
                        would more than likely tell you that “There are no 
                        opportunities”, or something along those lines. 
                        But this attitude appears to come from the lack of 
                        job opportunities that are presented in the film 
                        industry and doesn’t allude to other opportunities 
                        that are available to everyone who wants to be in film.</p>
                    <p>What the internet has done above all else is allow any 
                        one person to communicate with anyone else in the world, 
                        more or less. This has in turn enabled us to share 
                        information and resources that we can leverage to 
                        our advantage. This is especially the case in film 
                        where there are no barriers to entry. An example of 
                        the opposite of this is becoming a doctor where you 
                        require a medical degree. In film, there are no 
                        prerequisites. And now, with so much information 
                        on how to make a film and how to make a living in 
                        film that’s freely available, equipment becoming 
                        cheaper and cheaper, more and more talent available, 
                        at least in highly populated areas around the world, 
                        and relatively free access via the internet to distribute 
                        your films, it is easier than ever to create a film, share 
                        it with the world and earn money off of it. However, this 
                        does present a problem, a new problem that the film industry 
                        isn’t addressing.</p>
                    <p>Because it is easier than ever for you to make a film and 
                        share it with John Doe from the other side of the world, 
                        it is also to a certain degree as easier for John Doe to 
                        make and share his film with you. Everyone in the world 
                        now has the opportunity to make and share a film with 
                        everyone else. On top of this, what the internet has 
                        also done is created a haven for old films. So not only 
                        are you competing with John Doe from who knows where, 
                        but you are also competing against all the other amazing 
                        films that have been made through film’s history. The 
                        internet has made it possible for anyone to make a 
                        living making films, but has also made the industry 
                        incredibly competitive and noisier than ever.</p>
                    <p>What all of this indicates is that the problem isn’t one 
                        of opportunity, but is one of differentiation. With all 
                        this noise, you are virtually forced into having to make 
                        something unique in order to give yourself a chance of 
                        making a living in film. If you are making any film that 
                        has been done before then why would someone watch your 
                        film when they could just as easily watch the film that 
                        has already been made? You might have a good answer to 
                        this, but what is often missed here is that because there’s 
                        a variety of the type of film you are making, the profits 
                        get distributed unevenly across films of that type, with 
                        what the public perceives as the best of that type of film 
                        getting the biggest share of the profits and the rest of 
                        the films getting the breadcrumbs. This is the 80/20 
                        principle in action.</p>
                    <p>Where this isn’t situation really isn’t being addressed and 
                        where all of this becomes even more difficult for filmmakers, 
                        actors and every other talent in the film industry is that 
                        the main film industry, i.e. the studios, are not willing 
                        to take chances on films that are different to the standards 
                        set by the film industry. We could get into all the reasons 
                        why this is the case, but that’ll be incredibly exhausting and 
                        what is valuable here is that we recognize that the film industry 
                        isn’t really interested in taking risks on different film projects. 
                        And if you require any proof of this, then just watch the films 
                        that are coming out. Every film is based on other films. There are 
                        rarely, if any, new films being made. It is even very often a 
                        requirement of the main film industry to ask a filmmaker who is 
                        pitching a film idea to them what other films the film they’re 
                        pitching is like. There’s a real parity issue among the main 
                        film industry. </p>
                    <p>Now, as a creative, you’re left to make a tough decision. You can 
                        either conform to the standards of the industry, and while doing 
                        this might be more viable for you to get a film made, you won’t 
                        be making a film that’s different from the other films being made, 
                        as you’re going to have to fulfil the quotas set by the people with 
                        leverage over you, meaning you won’t be able to differentiate yourself 
                        from the rest of the films in the film industry and your film has very 
                        little chance of going far, in regards to earnings and viewership. 
                        Or you go your own way, but this also has its downsides, as your 
                        having to step into the unknown, and since it is unknown, who 
                        knows what will happen?</p>
                    <p>Even though this might all seem like doom and gloom, I am still very 
                        level-headedly optimistic about the state of film right now. And a 
                        part of this is because creatives do have opportunities to make 
                        different films, films that no one has ever seen before, that 
                        no one else could have imagined, due to the resources at our 
                        disposal. Sure, the main film industry isn’t willing to take 
                        a chance on you, but so what? Big deal. You have the opportunity 
                        to make the films that you’d like to see. And if this blog post 
                        is anything it’s an incentive for all the filmmakers out there 
                        who have something different to offer, who have a flare, a style, 
                        who are inspired to make films in a unique way, that we’ve never 
                        seen before to deny the nay-sayers and take a chance on yourself. 
                        This was always the wisest approach to making a living with film, 
                        but now more than ever, because of the dynamics of the film industry, 
                        it’s really your only option. Don’t let all the doubters stop you. 
                        Make the film that inspires you. Just be pragmatic about it.</p>
