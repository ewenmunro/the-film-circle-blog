                <p>The Film Circle is a blog that was founded in 2022 to provide a new way of looking at film.
                    This blog is not for the faint hearted and is not intended to be a new dogmatic approach to film.
                    The founder is simply sharing ideas that he feels may not be considered when it comes to film and filmmaking. What you do with those ideas is on you.
                    The Film Circle is not a prescription, but an exploration.</p>
